# Budgeting-App
We used to write down all the transactions we made using a notebook or spreadsheet to understand how we spent our money. These approaches can be pretty time-consuming and require much effort. Budgeting apps help achieve financial goals by automating the tediousness of tracking personal budgets. 

In this project, I aim to derive insights into customers of a budgeting app. I use a dataset of 634 recurrences (transactions) that come in two types: savings (N = 153) and monthly expense (N = 481). Without any missing values, the dataset contains :
- Information about 170 customers
- Amounts used for savings and expenses
- Days of the month when the money gets returned to customers to pay for expenses due
